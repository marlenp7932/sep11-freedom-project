# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Marlen Penafort

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about (in this specific situation) taking real problems and aiming to make something with code to 'solve' or help solve this issue. The purpose of this blog is to walk through the complete process of making my specific Freedom Project product, documenting the journey of the idea and brainstorming to the final working product.

## Content
For my project, I am making a book organizer app (dubbed Book Nook / Worm). This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Google App Scripts in order to make this application / automator.

## Implications
Some of the implications of the **social** sense is it can help people be more involved with books and reading, as being able to easily keep track of the books one is reading can be a huge motivator to keep going. In a more **global** sense, the education of literature can be easier to manage as this list, while keeping track of books being read can be used by more than one person, or can be used as a class book tracker, tracking books that classrooms start all together.

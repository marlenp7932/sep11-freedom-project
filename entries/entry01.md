# Entry 1 - Making a Decision 
### 11.08.21

**Intro** <br>
This year in SEP 11 we begin working on the Freedom Project. The task is to choose out a specific idea to create using the Javascript skills we are learning. After weeks of tinkering with different tools and researching the different products that can be made with said tools, we had to decide what would we be using to create the product of our choice. 

**Choosing a Topic & Tool** <br>
The first step in this process was choosing what I would be creating. In the week that we were deciding what we wanted to make, I had been into reading a lot, so I decided I wanted to do something that surrounded the idea of reading, and books. After I decided that, I took a moment to wonder, "*What is something I would want that would be useful?*" One of the first things that came into mind was some sort of app that would be helpful when organizing books. What does this mean? I wanted to create something that would be able to <br>
* Make a list of books
* Organize said list in order of read and to be read 

But, I also had a few ideas of what I wanted to include in an app. I, as many others, thought of something super intricate and complicated to make. I thought of an app that would be able to 

* Save information
* Have user authentication 
* Something that would have a sleek design and layout
* Be able to take information from the internet (book titles, authors etc) <br>
Basically, all the functions of a fully functional organizer app. <br>
Once I had a rough idea of what I wanted, I had to consider tools. In the back of my head I knew I wasn't going to be able to make the fully functional app, so while looking for tools, I looked for something that could have all the things I wanted, I looked for a tool that specifically saved user data, because no matter what I made, that was a factor that I needed to make for this program to even minimally function.<br> 
Through the list, my first thoughts were to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), since the main thing I heard about it was it functioned well with saving user data. 

**Final Decision** <br>
After all the consideration the **full idea** was to make a program that made a list of books for the user, using Google App Scripts (for a **M**inimum **V**iable **P**roduct)
The full list of desired functions is 
* The user will add a book + author
* It will list with the book along with the date added
* The list can be easily added from and deleted
* When user chooses a books, and reads it, they will be able to then add date started + finished, and an *optional* rating 


**Throughout the Process...** <br>

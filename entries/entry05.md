# Entry 5 - Finishing the MVP
### 04/26/22

**Intro** <br>
After learning our tools, the MVP was due and submitted. While working on it I was successful, but not with a few errors mixed in there. Also, plans don't always go exact, and I had to change some original ideas I had when I realized they are not actually as necessary to the MVP as I initially thought. 
**Figuring out small details** <br>
- appending, making it so it goes into the appropriate lists (big one), proper order etc 
**MVP for myself** <br>
- how i got it to work for myself 
**MVP for others** <br>
- how i got it to (semi) work for other uses 
**Skills / Design Process** <br>
**Beyond MVP (reflection)** <br>
- I want to be able to figure out the error of the multi spreadsheets ( if its even possible) because once that error is cleared, if I add more CSS to the spreadsheet AND the web page, it will be a much better functioning app

# Entry 5 - Finishing the MVP
### 06/02/22

**Expo** <br>
While giving my elevator pitch, my main takeaways are how I should present. I followed a more strict structure at first with a student, and in that I realized that it didn't really work. So after giving my pitch and modifying more and more times, I realized its really much more clean and natural if I ignored the strict scripted structure and just saying whatever I felt like saying about my project. Because of this, I was able to give a more interactive and cleaner presenation of my pitch, which from this I think I'll be taking away mainly more skills on elevator pitches specifically, to just be less strict and more loose on my thoughts. Another takeway I'm truthfully taking is to be proud of smaller products. While presenting all throughout the expo, I felt my work was extrenely underwhelming which made me nervous to even explain it, but after seeing what the judges thought after I finished presenting, and the reactions of some people to my project, I realized that even the small thing is somehthing to be proud of. The judges scores is what confirmed it for me, which made me realie I should be more proud of all the work I do , something thats a considerbly important takeaway.

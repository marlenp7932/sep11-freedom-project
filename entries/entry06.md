**Expo** <br>
While giving my elevator pitch, my main takeaways are how I should present. I followed a more strict structure at first with a student, and in that I realized that it didn't really work. So after giving my pitch and modifying more and more times, I realized it's really much more clean and natural if I ignored the strict scripted structure and just said whatever I felt like saying about my project. Because of this, I was able to give a more interactive and cleaner presentation of my pitch, which from this I think I'll be taking away mainly more skills on elevator pitches specifically, to just be less strict and more loose on my thoughts. Another takeaway I'm truthfully taking is to be proud of smaller products. While presenting all throughout the expo, I felt my work was extremely underwhelming which made me nervous to even explain it, but after seeing what the judges thought after I finished presenting, and the reactions of some people to my project, I realized that even the small thing is something to be proud of. The judges' scores confirmed it for me, which made me realize I should be more proud of all the work I do , something that's a considerably important takeaway. <br>
**In-Class Presentations** <br>
From in class presentations, I seemed to also realize the same thing I did for the expo, which was that my presentation could have been much better and more interactive if I had been more comfortable and less ridgid with what I was saying. Both experiences made me realzie that I need to be less structured for presentations. Something else that I took away from specifically making the presentation is too always plan out my time correctly. While watchingohters present I do admit I added some parts to my slides that everyone else had that I originally did not have, like a main takeways slide. After I presented and everyone else also finished I realized there were multiple thing I wanted to add but realized very last minute, so something else I'm learning from this is to make better plans and consider all ideas before finalizing. Finally something I learned from just the general criticism ais to speak louder of course but also bemore interactive because I didnt get a lot of uestions or comments Nad I think its bevause i didnt explain things that well. <br>

**EDP + Skills** <br>
In the **E**ngineering **D**esign **P**rocess, while I overall finished the MVP, I still see myself in stage 7, improving as needed. For me, the project is not at its full capacity, and I see so many things that can be added and done to it to improve it and make it an overall much better app. Because of this, I have already made plans to improve it and constantly work on it, which leaves me in stage 7 of improvement until I have reached all the (realistic) goals and ideas I have for the project. As for skills, I definitely focused on communication here, regarding presentations, since most of the last week has been me practicing public speaking and presenting my project to a lot of people. Another thing I worked on while forming my presentations was consideration, as I had to think about other users and my projects use and impact, since I had a focus on my project serving a purpose. <br>
